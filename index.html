<h2 class="title"> Introduction</h2>
    

<p>     This is a free and open source project made by few students and anyone intrested sharing 
hacking or linux skill or anyone willing to learn hacking are wellcome here 
</p>

<h2 class="title">Disclimer</h2>
<p>   This whole project is for educational purpose only and we suggest that you should gain full permission before doing anything on their network even before scanning</p>

<h2 class="title">What is this all about?</h2>
<p class="discription">   We all know what hacking is and we've seen lot of hacker in movies right? the one always with masks and they just press one key and the system is hacked . That's not realy how things work a simple simple scan can even take more than the whole movie(depents on what your scanning).Inorder to be a hacker (or just to know how it works) we should at least know about linux and how to execute a command, becouse now days everything is available on github from simple phishing scripts to whole hacking framework, Hacking using those scripts still make you a hacker but you will be known as a "script kiddie" (the person who plays with scripts) and who does not even know what he is doing </p>
